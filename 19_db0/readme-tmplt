DISCOVERIES:
----------------------------------------------------
* cursor.fetchall() gets all the things that matched your previous "query"
  which was via a command like "SELECT * FROM ..." where you select,
  and it outputs them into tuples/lists
*

====================================================


QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:
----------------------------------------------------
Q: Is there another way to look at the tables besides using fetchall
   since it wasn't in the notes, and the notes said just to use
   SELECT?
Q: How do I use sqlite3 at home?
C: What will running sqlite3 on a data base do in particular? Will
   it display it, or something else?
