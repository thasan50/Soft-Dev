        <h4>Why think about tortoises?</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-6 columns">
            <p>Tortoises are ancient creatures, having been around for more than 230 MILLION years!!!!! There are actually no wild tortoises native to scandinavia. They are from the family "Tetsudinidae" and coexisted with dinosaurs.

          <div class="large-6 columns">
            <p>It is believed that the word tortoise originates from the latin word "tortus", meaning twisted. It is thought that this is a reference to their bent legs, distinct from any other species of turtle. Their legs are made for land life, and they do not swim like turtles.

        <h4>Our Favorite Tortoise Facts</h4>

        <p>There are reports of tortoises lviing for almost 2 centuries. The survival rate for these hatchlings are exceptionally low, with only an estimated 2-5% reaching adulthood. </p>
        <p>Tortoises have an exoskeleton and an endoskeleton. The shell has three main parts: the top carapace, the bottom plastron, and the bridge that fuses these pieces together. You can't see them, but every tortoise has ribs, a collar bone, and a spine inside its shell.</p>
