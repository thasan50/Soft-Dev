## K35: Now Again for the First Time
### Due: 2025-03-17m before class

#### GOAL
Put the machine through its paces. Judge its abilities. Guage its utility.

#### TASK
_Step 0: Form dynamic duo with shoulder buddy. Conjure TNPG. Summon duckies._
1. As a duo, review one of your submissions for P0.
1. Repeat for other teammate.
1. Designate driver and codriver/mapreader/scribe.
1. Engage with machine...
   - Driver: start a new chat with gh copilot
   - Codriver: provide the smarts.
   - Together, poke/prod/goad the machine into completing P0.
   - Each time you reach a "milestone," copy the chatlog into a plaintext file for posterity.
1. Once you have produced a working version, pause to compare this to each of your P0 submissions... and NOTE ***EVERYTHING*** NOTABLE.

--- 

##### Specifications/Guidelines:
* Cite everything.
* PROTIP: When beginning, copy the entirety of each of your P0 codebases into a convenient location in the filesystem.
* `chatlog.txt` will contain ONLY copied conversations with the chatbot.
* `log.txt` will contain all your other notes, as well as general/overarching musings.
* If you find it more convenient and/or organizationally sensible, create as many `chatlogXX.txt` files as you like. (_Use this numbering format._)
* Aim to get a CSS-free version working first (all the way through the last step above). Then incorporate CSS as a "stretch goal."

##### DELIVERABLE
* In your heading, replace your name with your TNPG and roster.
