DISCO:
* If you import a Python program, it automatically runs anything that isn't in
a function.
* Form seems to be a built in feature of html, and having action="/auth" allows a input text box. However, in what way can it be used to log a certain user in?

* By requesting headers, the terminal returns several lines of information regarding the current machine and browser.

* When uncommenting the comment that requests a username, the webapp returns a KeyError: 'username'
	->but since users have to enter the username in the page, how is it possible for variable to have value before user input?
	->having this request in the authorization page does work, however. I'm assuming because we now have information on the username that the user previously submitted
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
* What is the difference between GET and POST in general, and how do they affect
the Flask webpage?
* What is the significance of DIAG?
 *What function is app.py using when requesting headers? does the "***" play a role? What does it even do. 
	-> uncomment code to test

 *When running testmodO.py, where does the return statement go if we aren't running a webapp? The print statements do, however, get printed in the terminal
