NOTES:
- Overall we think the task was pretty straightforward, especially with how the prior tasks/lessons introduced
  us to all the concepts we would need to complete this one.
- We wondered if there is an alternate, or maybe "optimal" way to do this task. We noticed that pretty much the only
  way for us to move on to get the link in its specific tag was to break down the process and remove some of the
  "automation" we had by using the 2nd for loop. Is there another way that would be better? Also is there a way to use
  if statements or other more traditional code writing practices? I guess this stems into a question that we will put as
  3rd in the QCC

EGO:
- My trio did not have time to discuss this article together but here are some of my thoughts/ponderings
- I have definitely noticed that at times I could get personally invested in my code, where if someone presented an
  alternative I may have been wary, maybe because I grew attached to what I had developed. But, for the most part,
  I would say that my CS "mentors" such as my teachers, have always shown necessity for keeping an open mind and
  at the very least testing your code very thoroughly, because it should be easy to own up to making a "mistake".
- However this practice, as I was reading, was a very new and different idea. It does seem really beneficial and a
  great way to improve on working. The idea of Bill G. going around and telling everyone about the bugs in his code,
  read almost idealistic to me, and not sure if that is somewhere I can get soon but it seems awesome. I feel like
  part of the problem is me default writing "his code", and I chose to leave it because it is what the reading
  advocates against, which is making code a group effort and not seeing the code as one person's.
- One of the big questions that came to my mind while reading this was how does one get started in creating this tight-knit
  group? I think the bond of such a group is awesome, and the value that it adds to the quality of coding produced is
  incredibly useful, but I was still wondering how to form such a group? Do you try to get as many people as you can
  "recruited" for this cause at the first place where you can do so?

QCC:
- Is there a "most optimal" way to do this?
- Is there a way to use if statements or other more traditional code writing practices?
- What is the code in the "{%...%}"? Is this some kind of notation that puts Python on the inside? We assume not, since
  the "{% endfor %}" is not part of Python. If not, then what coding language is this? Where can we find a reference for this?
  Should we expect to use this on higher levels than a for-loop in the future?
