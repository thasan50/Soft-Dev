## K22: Testing On-Ramps + Other FEFs
### Due: 2024-11-20w before class

_Step 0: Establish team comms. Fetch KtS._

#### Your MISSION:
As a duo, select 2 other nearby teams' front-end framework on-ramps and use them to come up to speed on each.

#### TASK
* make a website,
* using each other framework,
* to share with the world some easily-generated content of your choosing (suggestion: What have the duckies in your neighbourhood been up to lately?).

---
DISCO:
-  There's a lot of stuff that Anastasia and Andy gave regarding user interactivity like navbars, radio buttons, email forms, sidebars and more, that I don't believe will be necessary for just telling viewers of the website about the subject matter. (bt)
- I did not notice any ability to customize the classes to the extent that Tailwind allowed for. There you could write in all sorts of text styling and box design details, but with bootstrap it seems that you're generally required to use pre-existing classes. I haven't seen many descriptions of actual styling, which Tailwind provides shortcuts for. (bt)

QCC:
- What is SASS? (fd)
- What is ZURB? (fd)
- How would someone go about changing the colors of different sections of the page? (fd)
q0:
0 (bt)
0 (fd)

q0b:
N/A (bt)
N/A (fd)

q1:
I preferred Tailwind because there was much less ambiguity over which classes contained which type of styling. Both the bootstrap and foundation demos had sections with no other styling characteristics besides the ones that belonged to referenced classes. The name of a class would not tell you what to expect in regards to the type of styling. Even when you manually add styling, they don't appear to give you a shorthand for it in the manner that Tailwind does.

##### Specifications/Guidelines:
* In your heading, replace your name with your TNPG and roster.
* Display team name and roster on rendered page.
* _Nota bene: The DOCTYPE tag in your html file, if present, must be the first line. So insert your heading comment immediately after._
* Note anything notable in readme. Include these section headings with corresponding content:
  - DISCO
  - QCC
  - q0 (Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.)
  - q0b If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.)
  - q1 (_only to be answered after you have finished..._ At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.)
* _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in any source code you create.
<br>

##### PROTIPS:
* _Simplicity is divine_.
* Use Q&A forum liberally.
* Use your browser's developer console...
  - Have it open while you work.
  - Note anything notable. Share with DevoFam.
* Comment liberally in-line. Speak to your future self and/or future teammates.

##### DELIVERABLES:
* Save to workshop as indicated. (Example below applies to a team who wrote a tailwind on-ramp.)
* `index.html` will be considered your official submission, as before. You may include additional backups, as before.
